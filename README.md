# Look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/capyBearista/home-server/wiki)!

This page just holds some of the YAML files I've used to set up services with Docker Compose. All personal information has been removed and replaced with placeholder values, so it should be easy to fill them in for yourself. Feel free to copy them!

## Files Overview

### 1. minecraft-docker-compose.yaml
- **Service**: Minecraft server with Modrinth modpack

  - Replace `VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE` with your actual share code
  - Update `MODRINTH_MODPACK` to your preferred modpack
    - I *highly* recommend [Adrenaline](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline), a really great, lightweight performance modpack for servers
  - Update `MODRINTH_PROJECTS` to your preferred mods and datapacks
    - Check out [Spark](https://modrinth.com/mod/spark) to monitor your Minecraft server's performance

## Security Notes

- All passwords and personal information have been removed
- Replace all placeholder values before deployment
- Use strong, unique passwords for each service

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Customize the configuration files as needed
3. Create any required `.env` files
4. Double check with documentation for each service; it's readily available
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` in the appropriate directory
6. For public-facing services (e.g., Minecraft), ensure you set up the necessary port forwarding settings on your router!
